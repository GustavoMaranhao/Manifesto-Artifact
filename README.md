# Manifesto Artifact
Project developed as a sample of my work to be submitted with a job application.

The game has simple 2D graphics, created using image editing software, and the core o the game using the EnchantJS JavaScript Framework. The purpose of the it is to demonstrate some gameplay mechanics related to sprite management, 2D tiling and gameplay flow in a web based environment.

In the game the player controls a character and has to explore the ruins of the labyrinth of the Minotaur in Crete, although the environment is lightless there is no actual conflict, being only an exploration game. Throughout the maze there are a few signs telling the story of the legend supposedly living in the caverns.
